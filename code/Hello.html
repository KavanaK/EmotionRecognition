In this era of the digital age, information has become more accessible to us than ever before. We live in a world where there is an endless supply of content, generated to meet the ever growing need for it.  However, the longer we spend on our screen the more we blur the boundaries between what is excessive and what is common place. We are growing accustomed to information overloads; that inevitably take a toll on our mental health. This is especially prevalent in the case of information that could trigger a user, such as world news, fringe content, etc.

Therefore, a pressing need of the hour is to provide users with a means of consuming their information in a regulated and mindful manner.
